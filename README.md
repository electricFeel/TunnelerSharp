TunnelerSharp
=============

Just some exploratory. A secure tunnel implementation loosely based on Daniel J. Bernstein's (et. al) [MinimaLT](http://cr.yp.to/tcpip/minimalt-20130522.pdf).

This really shouldn't be used for anything, ever. It was just a minimal implementation to test out a couple of ideas and implemnent congestion control algorithms -- it should be treated as a test bed.

The code should run on both Windows and OS X but has only ever been used in unit test/minimal client implementations.
